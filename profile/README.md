Explorify is an open source alternative to Survey Monkey and Google Forms that allows you to conduct surveys online, and also allows you to conduct surveys on-premise.

> NOTE: Explorify is under active development and most features are still experimental.

Surveys are a vital part of every organisation and the systems that support them are highly expensive and mostly not available to the general public. This is why we have created Explorify to be a better way to conduct surveys.

For researchers, students, SMEs, MMEs, Enterprises, and various organisations that want to own their surveys without giving away the data to monopolies of this industry. Explorify provides survey solutions like no other and it's free to use.
